# API Gateway System

The API gateway is the system's policy edge: it centralizes auth, routing, throttling, request shaping, and observability so backend services can stay focused on business logic.

## Core Design

	U[Client] --> G[Gateway]
	G --> A[AuthN/AuthZ]
	G --> V[Validation]
	G --> T[Throttling]
	G --> R[Routing]
	G --> S[(Backend Services)]
```

## Responsibilities

| Concern | What The Gateway Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | Authentication and authorization |
| Safety | Validation and request limits |
| Routing | Path-based or header-based dispatch |
| Observability | Logs, metrics, traces, correlation IDs |
| Shape | Headers, response transforms, versioning |

## Failure Modes

- If the gateway is down, clients may lose access to all backend services.
- If throttling is too strict, the gateway can become a bottleneck itself.
- If auth checks are inconsistent, the gateway can expose invalid routes.
- If tracing is missing, debugging distributed failures becomes much harder.

## Interview Framing

1. Start with the difference between edge policy and backend business logic.
2. Explain which concerns should stop at the gateway and which should continue downstream.
3. Mention fallback behavior, timeout budgets, and circuit breaking.
4. Close with observability and safe rollout strategy.

## Quick Summary

| Item | Interview-Ready Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Core idea | API Gateway System helps candidates discuss requirements discovery, API and data modeling, bottleneck analysis, and trade-off defense with clarity. |
| What to emphasize | Start with the problem it solves, then explain trade-offs, constraints, and production impact. |
| Senior signal | Connect the concept to scale, reliability, operability, cost, and team ownership. |
| Common trap | Giving a definition without explaining when the approach works, when it fails, and how to validate it. |

## Key Takeaways

- Define API Gateway System in one or two crisp sentences before expanding.
- Anchor the answer in constraints: scale, latency, consistency, correctness, cost, and maintainability.
- Compare at least one alternative and explain why it is weaker or stronger for the given scenario.
- Mention operational concerns such as monitoring, rollback, testing, ownership, and failure handling.
- Close with a practical rule of thumb that helps the interviewer see judgment, not memorization.

## Mental Models

| Mental Model | How To Use It In Interviews |
| --- | --- |
| Problem first | Explain what problem API Gateway System solves before naming tools or patterns. |
| Constraints shape design | A solution changes when throughput, latency, consistency, team size, or compliance changes. |
| Trade-off triangle | Balance correctness, complexity, and cost rather than claiming one perfect answer. |
| Failure-first thinking | Ask what breaks, how it is detected, and how the system recovers. |
| Evolution path | Describe a simple baseline, then evolve it as scale and requirements increase. |

Treat the case as a sequence: clarify goals, define scale, design the baseline, identify bottlenecks, then evolve the architecture.

## Real World Examples

| Scenario | How API Gateway System Shows Up |
| --- | --- |
| Startup MVP | Choose the simplest implementation that validates the product without hiding future migration paths. |
| High-scale platform | Focus on bottlenecks, partitioning, caching, queues, rate limits, and operational dashboards. |
| Enterprise environment | Discuss compliance, auditability, access control, data retention, and change management. |
| Incident review | Tie the concept to detection, mitigation, rollback, and prevention. |

Use it to rehearse a complete interview narrative from problem statement to production-ready design.

## Interview Perspective

| Interviewer Probe | Strong Candidate Response |
| --- | --- |
| Why this approach? | State the requirement that makes it appropriate and name the trade-off it accepts. |
| What can go wrong? | Cover overload, stale data, race conditions, partial failure, poor observability, or unclear ownership. |
| How would you scale it? | Move from single-node assumptions to partitioning, replication, caching, async processing, or sharding. |
| How would you validate it? | Use tests, metrics, load tests, shadow traffic, canaries, and post-launch review. |

A strong answer is structured as: **definition -> constraints -> design choice -> trade-offs -> failure modes -> production plan**.

## Common Mistakes

- Jumping into implementation before clarifying goals and constraints.
- Treating the topic as a memorized definition instead of a decision tool.
- Ignoring edge cases, failure modes, and degraded behavior.
- Over-engineering the first version without explaining why complexity is justified.
- Forgetting security, observability, data retention, cost, or team ownership.
- Failing to compare alternatives when the interviewer asks for trade-offs.

## Follow-up Questions

1. When would you choose this approach over a simpler alternative?
2. What constraints would make this design break down?
3. How would you measure whether the solution is working?
4. What would you change for 10x traffic, 10x data volume, or stricter latency?
5. How would you explain the trade-off to a product manager or engineering leader?
6. What is the rollback plan if the approach causes production issues?
7. Which parts should be automated, monitored, or tested first?

## Production Insights

| Concern | Production Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Observability | Track golden signals, business metrics, saturation, errors, and user-visible impact. |
| Reliability | Define SLOs, fallback behavior, retry limits, backpressure, and disaster recovery strategy. |
| Security | Validate inputs, enforce least privilege, protect sensitive data, and audit access. |
| Cost | Estimate compute, storage, bandwidth, operational overhead, and migration cost. |
| Maintainability | Keep ownership clear, document assumptions, and design for incremental change. |

Real systems need staged rollouts, SLOs, capacity planning, abuse protection, data retention, and operational runbooks.

## Cheat Sheet

| Question | Quick Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is it? | A concept or technique used to solve a specific engineering or interview problem. |
| Why does it matter? | It gives structure to decisions and helps explain trade-offs under constraints. |
| What should I mention? | Requirements, alternatives, complexity, failure modes, and production readiness. |
| What should I avoid? | Vague definitions, one-size-fits-all claims, and ignoring operational reality. |
| How do I sound senior? | Discuss when the approach should not be used and how it evolves over time. |

## Flashcards

## Practice Questions

1. Explain API Gateway System to an interviewer in 90 seconds.
2. Draw a diagram showing where this concept fits in a real system.
3. Compare this approach with one alternative and defend your choice.
4. Identify two bottlenecks and two failure modes.

## Revision Notes

- Start with the problem, not the terminology.
- Use a diagram to make the flow, ownership, or trade-off visible.
- Name constraints explicitly: scale, latency, consistency, correctness, cost, and operability.
- Discuss at least one alternative and one failure mode.
- End with validation: metrics, tests, rollout plan, and rollback strategy.
- Final interview move: summarize the recommendation in one sentence and state the key trade-off.
